## Background and data

This project aims at creating a movie recommendation system for users. It uses data on users, their ratings on different movies and movie genres to predict the next highest rated movie.

This data for this project is available online through: <https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
